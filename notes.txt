
Three attacks
 * Physical attack deals ATK damage
 * Magical attack oscillates (sinusoidal) between ATK/2 and 3*ATK/2 damage, advancing each time it's used
 * Final attack uses 50% energy meter but deals 2*ATK damage

Costs 50% energy meter to skip a space, using the faded advance icon

Scrolls that get more powerful the longer you wait to get them

Hm... what about an underwater space which sets you to being "underwater"
 * As long as you are "underwater", fading is more expensive and ATK is halved
 * Can only resurface and cease to be "underwater" by landing on a neutral space
 * We could have an era where most (all?) of the neutral spaces are underwater spaces
Ooh! Maybe a fire space that increases ATK as long as on fire but decreases HP every turn.
 * Only way to extinguish fire is to step on a water space
What if each era had an era-specific space that it introduced?
 * Then that space is used in all the later era, just not as often
 * Spiders could have a spider web space which decreases your energy
