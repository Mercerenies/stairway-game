
Three attacks
 * Physical attack deals ATK damage
 * Magical attack oscillates (sinusoidal) between ATK/2 and 3*ATK/2 damage, advancing each time it's used
 * Final attack uses 50% energy meter but deals 2*ATK damage

Costs 50% energy meter to skip a space, using the faded advance icon

== IDEAS ==

ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
What if each era had an era-specific space that it introduced?
 * Then that space is used in all the later era, just not as often
 * Spiders could have a spider web space which decreases your energy
Glass of Milk enemy ("Unspilled Milk") that spills into milk spaces if you inflict non-lethal damage
Milk Spaces that take 1 health; Glass of Milk Spaces that spill into several Milk Spaces, overwriting nearby spaces
Scrolls that get more powerful the longer you wait to get them
Flying characters take half damage from any non-flying attack (both enemies and players can be flying)
Item that makes the player fly briefly (Silver Feather)

WILL BE IMPLEMENTED
Hm... what about an underwater space which sets you to being "underwater"
 * As long as you are "underwater", fading is more expensive and ATK is halved
 * Can only resurface and cease to be "underwater" by landing on a neutral space
 * We could have an era where most (all?) of the neutral spaces are underwater spaces
Ooh! Maybe a fire space that increases ATK as long as on fire but decreases HP every turn.
 * Only way to extinguish fire is to step on a water space
Enemies need to not have their gimmick (spiders, pears, etc) apply if they miss their attack
Status effects apply to enemy groups right now, not individual enemies...
Item that grounds flying enemies (on Joan of Lark, it would be temporary, since she would have a secondary ability that allows her to take flight again)
Item that shoots into the air, counting as a flying attack even when the player is not flying (like an arrow)
Holy Fire might be too powerful against undeads; consider balancing
Sign spaces to warn and advise

CONSIDERING IMPLEMENTING
"Lightweight Shoes" that protect against certain spaces (like milk spaces)
"East Wind" that occurs periodically (with warning); a bunch of bad spaces in a row
Item that shows enemy HP once it gets down to a certain point (passive)
Rage Space that gives the player +N ATK modifier (lowers every time you move, as it's ATK modifier)

DO NOT LOAD A SAVE FILE IF YOU ARE ALREADY ADVANCED PAST THAT POINT!!!!!!!
